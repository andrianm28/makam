Spec: Domain modules > 9. Layanan (Order: Saat Duka hari-H, Terencana empty-plot, Perpanjangan Tambah Layanan); 7. Perpanjangan; 6. Pemesanan (cancellation effects); 10. Billing (earliest-due rule, Tidak Tertagih loss); stories 23, 48

## What to build

Add Layanan to the booking checkouts. Saat Duka checkout offers only "bisa hari-H" items for the burial day, billed pay-after on the same Tagihan (taking its due date so it stays pay-after); their Pekerjaan Layanan are Dijadwalkan at the order's confirmation. Cancelling the Saat Duka order refunds the hari-H Layanan unless already Sedang Dikerjakan. A Terencana checkout for a single plot offers only empty-plot items (cleaning, grass care, photo report), pay-first on the Terencana Tagihan (one due date, the earliest line). A Perpanjangan checkout at a Lokasi Mitra (ticket 40, both the OTP and manual paths) gets an optional "Tambah Layanan" step before payment, with the Layanan on the same Tagihan. All show in the sticky total bar.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Saat Duka: only hari-H items; lines on the Saat Duka Tagihan; Tagihan remains pay-after; jobs Dijadwalkan on confirmation, target = burial day.
- [ ] Saat Duka cancellation: hari-H jobs Dibatalkan and refunded unless Sedang Dikerjakan.
- [ ] Tidak Tertagih: hari-H Layanan at a Lokasi are lost by their fulfiller like the Petak tariff (no Pencairan).
- [ ] Terencana: empty-plot items only, offered only when a single plot is picked; the Tagihan's due date is the earliest of hold expiry and the Layanan due rule.
- [ ] Perpanjangan: an optional "Tambah Layanan" step before payment offers the Lokasi's Layanan for that grave; the lines go on the Perpanjangan Tagihan, whose due date becomes the earliest of its lines (so the Layanan rule, at most 24 h after issue, applies when a Layanan is added); payment extends the Hak Pakai and schedules the Pekerjaan Layanan.
- [ ] One Biaya Layanan Platform per Tagihan (shared with the order).
- [ ] Tests: offered items per checkout (Saat Duka, Terencana, Perpanjangan); Tagihan kind and due date; scheduling at confirmation; cancellation refunds; Tidak Tertagih loss.
